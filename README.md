# Course Policies and Course Information

## Equity and Inclusion
Bakersfield College is committed to creating and fostering a positive, safe and conducive learning environment based on open 
communication where diversity, equity, and inclusion are recognized, valued and inform thoughtful decision-making and action. 
BC embraces individual difference and expects all employees and students to respect these differences and accept an understanding 
that individuals have unique perspectives, behaviors, and worldviews that may be different from their own.

## Academic Honesty and Plagiarism Policy
Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated. Each student in this course will abide by the Academic Honesty Policy described in the [Academic Information and Standards](https://www.bakersfieldcollege.edu/sites/bakersfieldcollege.edu/files/1617Catalog_AcademicInfo.pdf) section of the Bakersfield College Catalog. A violation of our academic honesty and plagiarism policy will be immediately reported to the Dead of Student Life plus zero points earned for any assignment involved for each student involved. No excpetions.

## Attendance
Attendance is mandatory. The school policy allows up to 2 weeks of absences before I am required to drop you. If you are tardy, you will be assessed an absences for every 2 tardies. The attendance policy as outlined in the campus catalog. Students must notify me in the event of class absences.  Any student that is absent for more than two weeks without prior instructor notification may be dropped from the course. If you do not want to be in the class then you must drop yourself from the course.  I will not retroactively drop you if you miss one of the “last day” to drop the course dates.  These dates are listed in the colleges academic calendar under [Important Dates](https://www.bakersfieldcollege.edu/important-dates). It is also expected that students will notify me before class in the rare instance of needing to leave class early.  Students, not notifying me in advance, may be marked absent upon their early departure.

### Group Activities  
Collaboration in class while working on assignments is encouraged. Various projects in class will require group work. Students who do not participate equally with others on assigned group projects will receive a grade of zero. 

Please be sensitive to the learning environment and the needs of each and every student in class. Avoid causing distractions or engaging in non-class activity. 

## General Classroom Etiquette
The intent of the classroom etiquette policy is to outline the need to have considerations for other students within your class. The following guidelines
have been provided to help you understand what this means.

* Digital devices should be silenced, turned off, or otherwise muted. 
* Prepare your desktop/tabletop area before the lecture starts. Prepare to leave once the lecture is concluded. Not before.
  * If you're in a computer lab, get logged in promptly. 
* No eating in the classroom.
  * If you're in a computer lab, do not bring in outside beverages.
* Sleeping is now allowed. If you are tired, please rest outside of the classroom. If you'd like, you can stand up in the back of the class.
  * If you are asleep you will be asked to leave. 


## Digital Devices (Cell phones, Personal Computer Devices, etc.)
Cell phones and cell phone usage is a classroom disruption. You know how to use and operate your devices. It is expected that you will turn cells phones off or otherwise silence your devices before class starts and respond only after class ends. If class has not started, please do not
have conversations within class on your device. Carry your conversation outside of the classroom. If there is an an emergency, you should leave the class to answer your calls or messages. Do not send text messages while in class. Again, have your conversations outside of class. This includes any
other social media platform that has messaging capabilities. Do not conduct personal conversations when the instructor is lecturing. Disciplinary action including removal from class will result. Personal computers or other electronic devices should not be used in class for non-class related activities. In classes with Labs or other areas where computers are being used, these systems are provided for classroom activities only.
